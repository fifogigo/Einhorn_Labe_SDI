// First idea, lets see if we can get all the points while calculating a vector.....something
// Ok, going to add a vector, increment the vector, and readd the vector
var arrayElement1 = prompt("Please enter the X value for the first vector:"); // this is to get the first array element
var arrayElement2 = prompt("Please enter the Y value for the first vector:"); // this is to get the second array element
var arrayElement3 = prompt("Please enter the X value for the second vector:"); // this is to get the third array element
var arrayElement4 = prompt("Please enter the Y value for the second vector:"); // this is to get the fourth array element

console.log(arrayElement1 + "," +arrayElement2 + "," +arrayElement3 + "," + arrayElement4);
